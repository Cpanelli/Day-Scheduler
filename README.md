# Work Day Scheduler

Work Day Scheduler is a simple calendar app that helps you schedule and organize your workday. It allows you to input and save tasks for various hours of the day, and it color-codes the time blocks to indicate past, present, and future hours.

## Features

- Easily schedule and save tasks for specific hours of the day.
- Color-coded time blocks:
  - Gray: Past hours
  - Red: Present hour
  - Green: Future hours
- Data is saved in your browser's local storage, so your tasks persist even after you close the app.

## How to Use

1. Open the Work Day Scheduler in your web browser.
2. The current date and day of the week will be displayed at the top of the page.
3. You'll see time blocks for each hour of the workday from 9 AM to 5 PM.
4. To add a task, click on the textarea for the corresponding hour.
5. Enter your task and click the save button (the floppy disk icon) to save it.
6. Your task will be saved and displayed in the time block.
7. The time blocks will be color-coded:
   - Gray: Past hours
   - Red: Present hour
   - Green: Future hours

## Local Storage

Your tasks are saved in your browser's local storage, which means they will persist even if you close the app or refresh the page. You can come back to the app later, and your scheduled tasks will still be there.
